You can now open up the ${chalk.blue('assessment-exam-student')} folder in your text editor.

Then, ${chalk.blue('cd')} into ${chalk.blue(testId)}.

To answer the questions, edit the code in the ${chalk.blue('answers')} folder.

To run the tests for a particular question, run:

	${chalk.blue('npm run question <Question Number>')}

For example:

	${chalk.blue('npm run question 0')}

There is no need to submit manually. Your answers are submitted automatically whenever you run the tests.

${chalk.magenta('Note!')} It is okay for you to Google for syntax or function use, but do ${chalk.magenta('not')} Google for the answers to the particular questions.

Have fun! üë©‚Äçüíª
