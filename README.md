## Exam Installer for Lighthouse Labs

Usage:

From your root directory (e.g. `/vagrant` in your Vagrant instance) run:

```
npx exam-installer <GitHub Username> <Test ID>
```

For example, I might run:

```
npx exam-installer NimaBoscarino web-01
```

Make sure you use the GitHub username that you have registered on Compass. Your instructor will provide you with the proper test ID. This will take a little while to run! After the installer has finished running, you will see instructions printed in your terminal.
