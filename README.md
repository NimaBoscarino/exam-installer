## Exam Installer for Lighthouse Labs

Usage:

Install this package globally, to be used as a command line tool:

```
npm i -g exam-installer
```

Then, from your root directory (e.g. `/vagrant` in your Vagrant) run:

```
exam-installer <GitHub Username> <Test ID>
```

For example, I might run:

```
exam-installer NimaBoscarino web-01
```

Make sure you use the GitHub username that you have registered on Compass. Your instructor will provide you with the proper test ID. This will take a little while to run!
